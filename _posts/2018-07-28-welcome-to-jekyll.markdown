This is just a simple post to make sure that the site is in working
condition. This will (ideally) be served by a simple http server
written in `Rust`. For now, I may serve it on GitHub Pages until I get
back to my linux machine, considering the following code snippet won't
even run on my Windows machine.

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!\n")
}
```
